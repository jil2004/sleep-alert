# Eye Detection with Alarm

This is a Python script that uses OpenCV to detect eyes and sound an alarm if they are closed for more than a minute. This can be used as a safety feature for drivers or others who need to stay alert and focused.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you'll need to have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (cv2) library for Python
* `playsound` library for Python

### Installing

#### Python 3.x

You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

#### OpenCV

To install the OpenCV library, you can run the following command:

 pip install opencv-python
 
#### `playsound` library

To install the `playsound` library, you can run the following command:
pip install playsound


### Running the Script

To run the script, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, run the following command:

python main.py


This will open up your computer's webcam and start detecting eyes. If the eyes are closed for more than a minute, an alarm will sound.

### Exiting the Script

To exit the script, press the 'q' key on your keyboard.
